It is very important that you understand these things before you start using DKPerms. Permissions \u00b6 Every plugin installed on your server usually brings its own permissions, these permissions are required to restrict commands and features to different users and groups. These permissions allow you to control which user has access to a command or feature. The permission node is a sequence of letters and is provided by the respective plugin author. For example, to ban ( /ban dkrieger hacking ) a user with DKBans the permission dkbans.ban is required. Meta \u00b6 The meta is a key value based information that can be set to groups and users. Unlike permissions, the meta contains a value that can be read by another plugin. For example, you might want to display a prefix before the player name in the tab list, so you can set a meta entry with the key prefix and your value. Groups (Permission groups) \u00b6 Usually different players have the same permission. In this case DKPerms has groups, which you can give permissions, metas and other groups, later on you can assign this group to different players. For example, you can create a moderator group, which contains permissions for banning, kicking and teleport. When now a new moderator joins your team, you can easily assign the moderator group to him/her, and he/she will automatically get necessary permissions. Server Groups \u00b6 A server group is a collection of different servers, every server is automatically in a server group the name of the group is the first part of the group separator ( - ) defined in the configuration For example, you have a different SkyWars servers called: * SkyWars-1 * SkyWars-2 * SkyWars-3 The server group for these servers is called SkyWars , if you now need the same permissions on all skywars servers, it is much easier to assign the permission to the server group instead to each server. Scope \u00b6 DKPerms is based on a tree structure, everything in DKPerms (Objects, permissions, groups etc.) belongs to a scope and is only valid for this and all subordinate scopes. This example shows how a tree can look like: Nemspace=Minecraft ServerGroup=Lobby Server=Lobby-1 World=World-1 Server=Lobby-2 If the permission dkbans.ban is assigned to a player on the scope Nemspace=Minecraft\\\\ServerGroup=Lobby the permission is valid on Lobby-1 and Lobby-2 . Permission Object \u00b6 A PermissionObject holds permission data and can be a group, user or a custom type. Objects are registered in DKPerms and assigned to a third-party resource.","title":"Defintions"},{"location":"dkperms/defintions/#definitions","text":"This page describes the key definitions and the structure of DKPerms.

Before you ask a question in our support, please check this page and make sure that the question is not already answered. How can I create a default group? \u00b6 DKPerms handles default groups in its meta. You can set a group as default on the whole network or on a specified server. If you set the meta default to true of a group, all players will automatically gets all permissions of the group, but the group is not directly assigned to the player. If you want set a group to each player when he joined the server, you can set the meta ``defaultAssign to true```, so every new player automatically receives this group. Examples /perms group <group> meta set default true /perms group <group> meta set defaultAsign true /perms group <group> meta set default true world=world-1 In this case the group is only default on world-1","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"dkperms/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"These page contains some questions which are frequently asked about DKPerms.
