With the new template architecture you can create innovative punishment procedures with calculation algorithms, different types of punishments and more. Introduction \u00b6 The template system consists of two parts, the template group and the template . A template group is a list of related templates. And a template contains the exact punishment information and belongs to a template group . Template Group A template group is usually bound to a command (.e.g. ./ban , ./cityBuildBan or ./warn ), and contains related templates. You are very flexible and can create as many template groups as you need. Template A template (e.g. hacking, advertising, provocation) contains exact information about the punishment, how he will be punished (ban, mute, warning etc.), how long the player will be punished and all other information. Punishment type \u00b6 DKBans offers four known punishment types, more can be added with extensions. BAN => The player is no longer able to join your server. MUTE => The player is no longer able to use the chat and LabyMod voice chat. KICK => The player will be kicked from the server. WARN => A simple warning message is sent to the player. Punishment calculation \u00b6 DKBans contains two different algorithms for calculating the best punishments for your bad players. AMOUNT calculation DKBans points system is an intelligent algorithm for calculating the best type and duration based on the unique player history. Each punishment adds a certain amount of points to the player's history, which is used to calculate the next punishment. You are also able to define divider and multiplier to get more accurate and better punishments for different reasons and templates. History types \u00b6 Another powerful technology of DKBans is the unique history system that allows you to create separate calculation units for amounts and points. For example, you can separate network and chat penalties into different histories, or even create a separate history for a server (e.g. CityBuild). Configure a template group \u00b6 A template group corresponds to a file in the ./plugins/DKBans/templates folder. There are already three default groups ( ban , report and unban ). If you need another group, e.g. for warnings or to create server punishments, simply create a new file. The file must contain the following header information: type DKBans differentiates between three core template types: PUNISHMENT , UNPUNISH and REPORT . calculation The calculation type to use, AMOUNT or POINTS (see above fill explanation) name The name of this template group, should be similar to the file name templates All templates of this group, see below. Example: type: PUNISHMENT calculation: AMOUNT name: ban templates: If you want to use this template group in combination with a command, you need to configure it in the punishment template section (line 190) in the commands.yml . Add this section with the name of the command and template group to your commands.yml : <template-group-name>: enabled: true name: 'ban' permission: 'dkbans.ban' aliases: ['mute'] Configure a template \u00b6 Each template group contains one to infinite number of templates. The template format looks different for the three template types. Punishment \u00b6 Required template group type: PUNISHMENT (see above) <id> The internal id of your template (use only number values) name The unique name of this template display The display name in the ban screen permission The required permission to use this template aliases Alternative names to use in commands hidden If True , the template will not be displayed in commands historyType The name of the history type to use for this template (See above for more information) messageKey An optional paramter for per reason punishment messages/screens (The name of the message key) <amount/points> The amount of punishments or points (depending on the selected calculation) type The punishment type (See above for more information) duration The duration of the punishment (not all punishment types have a duration) points Additional configuration for points (only in POINTS calculation) addedPoints Points to add to the history for this punishment pointsDivider The divider to use before the duration calculation Example: templates: 1: name: Hacking display: Hacking permission: dkbans.ban.reason.hacking aliases: - hacks - hacker hidden: false historyType: NETWORK category: Bans messageKey: test durations: 1: type: BAN duration: 30d 2: type: BAN duration: 90d 3: type: BAN duration: -1 points: addedPoints: 7 pointsDivider: 1.0 Report \u00b6 Required template group type: REPORT (see above) <id> The internal id of your template (use only number values) name The unique name of this template display The display name in the ban screen permission The required permission to use this template watchPermission The required permission to take and watch this report aliases Alternative names to use in commands hidden If True , the template will not be displayed in commands targetPunishment The target punishment when a report gets accepted (Format: @ ) Example: templates: 1: name: Hacking display: Hacking permission: dkbans.report watchPermission: dkbans.report.staff aliases: - hacking hidden: false targetPunishment: ban@Hacking Unpunishment \u00b6 Required template group type: UNPUNISHMENT (see above) Work in progress Import \u00b6 After you have configured the templates, you need to import them into your database using the following command: ./dkbans template import","title":"Punishment templates"},{"location":"dkbans/plugin-setup/punishment-templates/#punishment-templates","text":"DKBans V5 brings a completely redesigned punishment template system with more possibilities and flexibility to your server or network.

It is very important that you understand these things before you start using DKCoins. Bank Account \u00b6 A bank account is a user or joint account that holds money/coins of different currencies on a credit. A bank account is the highest object to which access can be controlled. Bank accounts can have members with different roles and withdrawal limitations and restrictions. Bank accounts can be hierarchical and depend on each other or work completely independent. Currency \u00b6 A currency is a type of money that is stored in a bank account. Currencies can function completely isolated and independent of each other, or can have a dependence, and the possibility of converting money into other currencies. Example 1 For example, you have a network with global coins and a city build currency. To achieve this, you can create two different independent currencies. Coins | Global coins, which you can get by playing games CityCoins | Only available on city build Example 2 Another example would be an advanced multi-currency game mode, for which you can create different currencies that can be exchanged. Dollar| Currency 1 Euro | Currency 2 Bank Credit \u00b6 In order to store money in different currencies in a bank account, DKCoins uses a bank credit that indicates the amount of certain currencies in a bank account. Each bank account can have a maximum one credit of each currency. Exchange rate \u00b6 Exchange rates are values that defines how much one currency is worth in another currency. The exchange rate can be defined for each currency and is used to convert the money into another currency. Transaction \u00b6 Every action that a user performs on a bank account is called a transaction. DKCoins logs every money change and creates clear bank statements.","title":"Defintions"},{"location":"dkcoins/defintions/#definitions","text":"This page describes the key definitions and the structure of DKCoins.

Follow these instructions exactly and contact our support if you have any questions or problems. Compatibility \u00b6 DKMotd supports Minecraft 1.8 - 1.17.1 and runs on all McNative supported platforms: Bukkit, Spigot, PaperSpigot, Yatopia, Tunity, Purpur, Airplane BungeeCord, Waterfall, Travertine, FlameCord McNative DKMotd is designed for running on multiple servers and supports all McNative messaging technologies: BungeeCord Proxy Network (Plugin Message Channels) CloudNet V2 (Multi proxy) CloudNet V3 (Multi proxy) DKMotd only support official Minecraft versions published by Mojang. Cracked (offline mode) is not supported. Requirements \u00b6 DKMotd supports java 8 - 1.17.1 and requires a stable internet connection (DKPerms downloads all necessary libraries dynamically). If you are using DKMotd on multiple servers, you also need a supported remote database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL, MongoDB et.c). Installation \u00b6 1. - Get A License \u00b6 DKMotd is a paid plugin and before you can start with the setup you have to purchase a license in the McNative Store . See also the DKMotd license agreement . 2. - Download \u00b6 To install DKMotd, download the latest loader here and move it to your plugins folder. Start your server. In this setup, we use the simple loader. If you are interested in the template loader to install multiple resources dynamically, checkout the McNative Docs . If you are using a network with multiple servers, you must usually only install DKMotd on your proxy server. 3. - Licensing \u00b6 After DKMotd has started you will see an error in your console ( Missing or wrong authentication credentials ). To license DKMotd to your server you have to enter your network credentials in the McNative config (You will find the credentials in the McNative console) or use your personal license key. Key Licensing If you want to continue with your personal license.key you just have to put it in the folder plugins/DKMotd . McNative Licensing If you want to work with McNative and is capabilities, enter your console credentials (you will find them in the McNative console on the left side) in the McNative configuration ( plugins/McNative/config.yml ). Restart your server, if everything worked correctly a folder named DKMotd should be created in ./plugins . (4. - Storage setup) \u00b6 After the installation you can optionally set up a storage solution like MySQL. Read more about storages here If you are using a network with multiple servers, you must connect to the same remote database.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"dkmotd/plugin-setup/installation/#dkmotd-installation","text":"The DKMotd installation is very easy and can be done in a few minutes.

It is very important that you understand these things before you start using DKPerms. Permissions \u00b6 Every plugin installed on your server usually brings its own permissions, these permissions are required to restrict commands and features to different users and groups. These permissions allow you to control which user has access to a command or feature. The permission node is a sequence of letters and is provided by the respective plugin author. For example, to ban ( /ban dkrieger hacking ) a user with DKBans the permission dkbans.ban is required. Meta \u00b6 The meta is a key value based information that can be set to groups and users. Unlike permissions, the meta contains a value that can be read by another plugin. For example, you might want to display a prefix before the player name in the tab list, so you can set a meta entry with the key prefix and your value. Groups (Permission groups) \u00b6 Usually different players have the same permission. In this case DKPerms has groups, which you can give permissions, metas and other groups, later on you can assign this group to different players. For example, you can create a moderator group, which contains permissions for banning, kicking and teleport. When now a new moderator joins your team, you can easily assign the moderator group to him/her, and he/she will automatically get necessary permissions. Server Groups \u00b6 A server group is a collection of different servers, every server is automatically in a server group the name of the group is the first part of the group separator ( - ) defined in the configuration For example, you have a different SkyWars servers called: * SkyWars-1 * SkyWars-2 * SkyWars-3 The server group for these servers is called SkyWars , if you now need the same permissions on all skywars servers, it is much easier to assign the permission to the server group instead to each server. Scope \u00b6 DKPerms is based on a tree structure, everything in DKPerms (Objects, permissions, groups etc.) belongs to a scope and is only valid for this and all subordinate scopes. This example shows how a tree can look like: Namespace=Minecraft ServerGroup=Lobby Server=Lobby-1 World=World-1 Server=Lobby-2 If the permission dkbans.ban is assigned to a player on the scope Namespace=Minecraft\\\\ServerGroup=Lobby the permission is valid on Lobby-1 and Lobby-2 .

These permissions allow you to control which user has access to a command or feature. The permission node is a sequence of letters and is provided by the respective plugin author. For example, to ban ( /ban dkrieger hacking ) a user with DKBans the permission dkbans.ban is required.","title":"Permissions"},{"location":"dkperms/defintions/#meta","text":"The meta is a key value based information that can be set to groups and users.

In this case DKPerms has groups, which you can give permissions, metas and other groups, later on you can assign this group to different players.

Why do I not have permission on BungeeCord? Why do I not have permission on Spigot? How can I create a default group? \u00b6 DKPerms handles default groups in its meta.

If you set the meta default to true of a group, all players will automatically gets all permissions of the group, but the group is not directly assigned to the player. If you want set a group to each player when he joined the server, you can set the meta ``defaultAssign to true```, so every new player automatically receives this group.
