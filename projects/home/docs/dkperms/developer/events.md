# DKPerms Events

DKPerms provides several events for better interaction with the plugin. You can use events in a 
normal Bukkit/BungeeCord listener with `@EventHandler` or subscribe to the McNative event bus.
If you need other events, create a [suggestion](../support.md#suggestions).


## DKPermsPermissionObjectCreateEvent


## DKPermsPermissionObjectDeleteEvent

## DKPermsPermissionCalculationEvent

## DKPermsScopeChangeEvent
